## Keyboard Layout Emulation – an extension for Blender
This Blender extension automatically reassigns all keyboard shortcuts to emulate a QWERTY
keyboard layout on a user-specified non-QWERTY keyboard layout, allowing users to type
QWERTY keyboard shortcuts while typing text in their preferred keyboard layout.

This allows users to benefit from the default keyboard shortcuts without changing their
keyboard layout for typing text/using shortcuts, making use of the design effort already
spent by others in designing the default keyboard shortcuts.

The default keyboard shortcuts include well over a thousand keyboard shortcuts involving
remappable keyboard keys. Tailoring all keyboard shortcuts to a different keyboard layout
in a way that is convenient for one-hand typing and with good mnemonics in the
corresponding layout is not a task everyone can afford.

### Usage
The add-on injects a dropdown above the usual `Preferences > Keymap` menu, allowing
the user to select an input keyboard layout on top of which to emulate QWERTY.
This dropdown includes buttons to add and edit new custom keyboard layouts, as well
as to apply/revert the emulation or edit some preferences.

For further instructions on how to use this extension and other helpful information,
